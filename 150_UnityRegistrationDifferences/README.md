#Task 15: Various registrations into the Microsoft Container

## How to start?

1. Get familiar with project 150_UnityRegistrationDifferences.
2. Project intentionally links to an older version of MS Unity.
3. Locate ```UnityRegistrationDifferencesTest``` class.
4. Review the test methods and see the differences and results of the 
   resolution.

## Solution

* There is no expected solution here. The purpose of this task is to provide
  a quick playground for testing registrations and perhaps provide an overview
  of various types of registrations and re-registrations.
