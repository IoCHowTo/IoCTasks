# IoCTasks

## Motivation

* Provide help to guys on team to understand the topic
* Provide a set of tasks which will allow to understand the basics, such as:
  * Inversion Of Control principle
  * Microsoft Unity IoC Container 
  * Differences between polymorphism and dependency injection
* Sample solutions for all tasks are provided separately for your reference
  * At first try to resolve tasks on your own. 
  * If you will get stuck feel free use appropriate sample solution to unblock yourself.

## Sources

* The best theoretical source on inversion of control and dependency injection is probably [Martin Fowler's article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)
* There is also very useful [StackExchange thread](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/205686) which is dedicated to the above mentioned article and is very helpful in understanding that IoC can have many forms
* The rest of sources includes:
  * [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921087.aspx)
  * Two CodeProject articles, [DI vs IoC](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/592372/Dependency-Injection-DI-vs-Inversion-of-Control-IO) and ]IoC with examples](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/380748/Inversion-of-Control-Overview-with-Examples)
  * two PluralSight courses, [one dedicated to IoC in general](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/inversion-of-control) and [the other in regards of ASP.NET MVC](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/ioc-aspdotnet-mvc4)
