#Task 14: Unit Testing With IoC

## How to start?

1. Get familiar with project 140_UnitTestingWithIoC.
2. Identify classes which can be unit tested.
3. Implement unit tests.
  * Consider usage of NUnit and Moq as needed.
  * Make sure you covered the ```Calculator``` class.
4. Implement support for additional operators (plus, divide).
5. Extend the unit test coverage for newly added operators.
6. Compare the differences against 090_UnitTestingWithoutIoC.

## Solution

* For more info about the sample solution please see IoCTaskSolutions, project 
  140_UnitTestingWithIoC.
* Read the comments throughout the code carefully, they contain important 
  information in regards inversion of control and dependency injection.
