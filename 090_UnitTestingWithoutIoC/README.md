#Task 9: Unit Testing Without IoC

## How to start?

1. Get familiar with project 090_UnitTestingWithoutIoC.
2. Identify classes which can be unit tested.
3. Implement unit tests.
  * Make sure you covered the ```Calculator``` class.
4. Implement support for additional operators (minus, divide).
5. Extend the unit test coverage for newly added operators.

## Solution

* For more info about the sample solution please see IoCTaskSolutions, project 
  090_UnitTestingWithoutIoC.
* Read the comments throughout the code carefully, they contain important 
  information in regards inversion of control and dependency injection.
